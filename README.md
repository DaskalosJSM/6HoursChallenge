# 6 Hour Challenge

Improve the *White Blood Cell* mobile game in 6 hours.

## Time Log

Challenge start: Wednesday, February 22nd 2023 @ 12:30PM EST

## Plans

After briefly playtesting the game, I have already come up with a few changes I'd like to make to the game:

- Changes to game mechanics:
    - Make Viruses eat the Red Blood Cells instead of having them be idle.
    - If a Virus consumes a Red Blood Cell, a score penalty is applied.
    - Consuming Viruses could extend the player's momentum.
    - Turn system overhaul:
        - Change the turns system to use an analog bar instead of a fixed number of turns.
        - Make the turns bar deplete on its own to disincentivize camping/farming.
    - Boost system overhaul:
        - Display boost direction and force as the player charges the boost
        - Apply drag to player movement
        - The longer a boost is charged for, the more of the turn bar is depleted
- Fixes/improvements:
    - [Complete] Fix UI canvases to properly scale dynamically.
    - Replace UI assets.
    - Add juice to players consuming Viruses/Red Blood Cells.
